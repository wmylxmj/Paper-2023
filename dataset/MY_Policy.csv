From 14 March to 17 March was previously coded as ""1G"" as the Education Ministry only advised for ""postponing"", and did state that schools can only be closed after the principals have sought the advice of the State Health Department and District Health Office. At that time, ""postponing gathering"" was not defined clearly, so it was difficult to whether it meant cancelling public events in schools or effectively cancelling all the teaching activities.    Given in only another few days, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced all nurseries, government and private schools, including boarding schools, international schools, tahfiz centres as well as primary, secondary and pre-university education institutions will be closed.    So now we think the order on 14 March was preparation for general school closure. So we changed ""1G"" to ""3G"".    https://web.archive.org/web/20200423201640/https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/03/14/covid-19-schools-advised-to-postpone-all-activities-programmes/1846545    https://archive.vn/FTCTf",OxCGRT

3713968,3713968,MY,2020-08-12,H3,2.0,,"Malaysia official statistics shows a main contact tracing app, MySejahtera, ‘had managed to detect 251 confirmed Covid-19 cases, or 3 per cent of 8,303 coronavirus cases, as of June 6’; the app was launched in late April. As of 10 August, this app has been downloaded by 13,284,611 users, which represented almost 60% of those with mobile phones in Malaysia’s 32-million population. [However, the percentage of people with mobile phones in Malaysia is unclear] ‘The percentage of bad data on MySejahtera, according to Dr Noor Azmi, is very low because about 10 million users’ IC numbers have been verified with the National Registration Department so far.’  https://archive.vn/A9F0U  Note: use of contact tracing apps doesn't affect the value of the contact tracing flag Health policies specialist Dr Khor Swee Kheng states that Malaysia’s manual contact-tracing system could handle daily cases when they were in the tens or hundreds as they were in this period. https://web.archive.org/web/20210518133050/https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3119162/year-after-its-first-coronavirus-case-malaysias",OxCGRT

Authorities have lifted stricter protocols, termed the conditional movement control order (CMCO), in most states.     Nationwide restrictions under the recovery movement control order (RMCO), which is the least stringent set of protocols, remain in effect across most parts of Malaysia through Dec. 31.     States implementing RMCO include Malacca, Pahang, Perlis, Sarawak, and Terengganu. Educational institutions remain closed until further notice.    The CMCO or even the enhanced movement control order continues in Kuala Lumpur, Sabah State, and specific localities in other states, including six districts in Selangor State, as well as parts of Johor, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Penang, and Perak, through Dec. 20.

Sporting events can occur, provided that organizers observe health guidelines. Food outlets and convenience stores can operate until 0200 nightly. Public transport can operate with protocols in place.    For the more stringent EMCO states, while measures may also vary by location, typical controls include the suspension of places of worship, and cultural, recreational, and sporting activities. Furthermore, the central government has designated areas recording more than 40 COVID-19 cases in the previous two weeks as red zones; such areas may see local restrictions. Central authorities may extend stricter curbs in some locations or expand the protocols to additional areas, depending on local COVID-19 activity.    Several state governments are maintaining additional statewide restrictions on top of those mandated by the central authorities. Some states may require businesses, such as hair salons and night markets, to remain closed. Additional curbs include limiting business operation hours, though exemptions are likely for essential services.  http://web.archive.org/web/20201221170524/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/409741/malaysia-covid-19-restrictions-adjusted-in-most-states-as-of-dec-7-update-18",OxCGRT

Travelers can leave the quarantine sites upon testing negative for COVID-19.

Up to 15 family members from different households will now be allowed to dine together for their reunion dinner, provided they live within 10km of each other, said the National Unity Ministry.  These family members are also not permitted to travel across state or district boundaries.    The ministry added that religious activities within houses of worship on Feb 11, Feb 12 and Feb 19 will now be permitted, subject to a 30-person limit. All individuals must also wear face masks and observe safe distancing.  Prayers must be kept to 30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of cleaning and sanitation before the next prayer session is conducted.    The easing of the restrictions comes three days after Senior Minister for Security Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Thursday that Chinese New Year celebrations would only be allowed among family members from the same household.  ...  Ismail Sabri also previously said that temple prayers would be limited to five members from the temple’s management committee.    With the exception of Sarawak, all states in Malaysia are currently under a movement control order (MCO) until Feb 18, as the country continues to battle a surge in COVID-19 cases.'    https://archive.vn/utwr5",OxCGRT

In a joint press conference with Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah in Putrajaya, the minister outlined that 80 per cent of all workers in the public sector, as well as 40 per cent of workers in the private sector, will be required to work from home. This will mean around 8 million fewer Malaysians who are commuting to work every day, he explained.   ...  In addition, businesses will have to comply with operating hours of between 8am and 8pm, he said. Retailers in malls, restaurants offering takeaways, shops offering laundry services as well as petrol stations not located on highways will also need to comply with this rule.   ""Our strategy is to reduce movement (of people) by reducing the number of people working in officers ... and to limit operating hours of the economic sector,"" said Mr Ismail Sabri.   He added that these restrictions will be implemented from May 25, and will be enforced throughout the country.   ...'    https://archive.vn/fHPiz",OxCGRT

Authorities have also granted conditional approval to the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine made by US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and manufactured in Belgium, Dr Noor Hisham said.  Malaysia had earlier approved another batch of Janssen vaccines that had been given the greenlight for emergency use by the World Health Organization.  The approvals come a day after Malaysia's health ministry said that it would stop administering the COVID-19 vaccine produced by China's Sinovac once its supplies end, as it has a sufficient number of other vaccines for its programme.  Malaysia started its national COVID-19 immunisation programme on Feb 24. It has administered a total of 12,647,558 doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of Thursday, with more than 4 million people - or 12.3 per cent of the population - fully vaccinated so far.'  https://archive.vn/mYP34    Second piece:  'Malaysia will soon allow the commercial sale of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Chinese firms Sinopharm (1099.HK) and Sinovac (SVA.O), the science minister said on Friday, as authorities try to ramp up inoculation rates amid surging cases.  Malaysia has one of the region's highest number of coronavirus infections per-capita but also one of its fastest vaccination rates. About 39% of its adult population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  The Sinopharm vaccine, which Malaysia approved on Friday for emergency use, would soon be open for private purchase, science minister Khairy Jamaluddin told a virtual news conference.  Meanwhile, Sinovac vaccines would be available commercially from Aug. 1, after it has completed the delivery of some 15 million doses procured by the government, he said.  ...  Malaysia had previously said it would stop administering Sinovac vaccines after supplies run out, and would instead rely largely on the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) mRNA vaccine for its national rollout. read more  On Friday, Khairy clarified that surplus Sinovac shots would remain available for those who may have allergy concerns with other vaccines.  ""There is no issue over Sinovac's efficacy,"" he said.  Malaysia would also consider purchasing more doses from Sinovac in the event of a shortfall of AstraZeneca vaccines from neighbouring Thailand, Khairy said.'  https://archive.vn/teN8e",OxCGRT
