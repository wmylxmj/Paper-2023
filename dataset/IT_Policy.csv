3034470,3034470,IT,2020-04-18,H8,3.0,True,"""on 18th April, the ISS released a guide for the prevention and control of Covid-19 infection within nursing homes, specifying organizational and structural requirements aimed at avoiding catching the virus, managing positive cases and guaranteeing an effective flow of information with Local Health Units and families. Among these, for example, family members and people with symptoms are not allowed to visit for the entire duration of the emergency; new residents can be authorized to move in after being tested for Covid-19 and must be placed in a dedicated area, isolated from other residents. Furthermore, nursing homes are recommended to avoid sending their residents to hospitals for diagnostic tests and medical visits. Group activities and the use of shared spaces are to be suspended; all staff, suppliers and maintenance workers must be properly equipped with PPE. As soon as a resident shows signs of a likely infection s/he must be isolated and tested immediately. If positive, they must be kept in isolation when structurally possible and, otherwise, transferred to an appropriately equipped facility. Special Units for Continuity of Care (for further information please see paragraph 3.2) are responsible for guaranteeing continuous communication with infectious disease specialists and protocols to be followed will be those emitted by the Directorates of each facility. Nursing homes with suspected or ascertained Covid-19 cases (even those awaiting transfer), must provide medical and nursing support 24 hours per day.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20210110070649/https://www.covid19healthsystem.org/countries/italy/countrypage.aspx ['Maintaining Essential Services']",OxCGRT

Under these provisions, persons traveling to Italy from member states of the European Union, states party to the Schengen Agreement (the non-EU states party to the Schengen Agreement are: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), the United Kingdom, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City State will no longer be required to self-isolate under the supervision of health authorities for 14 days unless they have stayed in other countries during the 14-day period prior to entering Italy. For those traveling from a country not listed above, including the United States, travel to Italy will be allowed only for proven work, urgent health needs, or to return to your place of residence.

Each region, however, rules it in its own way to determine what the preconditions for such visits are. While there is no clear start date for visits for every single region, the federal guidelines for re-opening seem to be in line with allowing visits in general, hence a downgrade to 2G seems most appropriate on review.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201203141332/https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/06/26/case-di-riposo-la-ripartenza-delle-rsa-e-in-ordine-sparso-tra-rischi-occupazionali-incertezza-sulle-visite-incognita-seconda-ondata-servono-linee-di-indirizzo-univoche/5842743/  https://web.archive.org/web/20210116211048/https://www.regione.piemonte.it/web/pinforma/notizie/regole-per-visite-nelle-case-riposo  https://web.archive.org/web/20201203141332/https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/06/26/case-di-riposo-la-ripartenza-delle-rsa-e-in-ordine-sparso-tra-rischi-occupazionali-incertezza-sulle-visite-incognita-seconda-ondata-servono-linee-di-indirizzo-univoche/5842743/  http://web.archive.org/web/20210110114711/https://www.trovanorme.salute.gov.it/norme/dettaglioAtto?id=75652",OxCGRT

The new decree keeps Italy's existing rules on face masks in place: everyone must wear them in enclosed public spaces such as shops, restaurants or public transport. They must also be worn in outdoor areas between 6pm-6am.    Masks must be worn ""in the spaces pertaining to places and premises open to the public as well as in public spaces (squares, open spaces, streets, promenades) where due to the physical characteristics it is easier for gatherings to form, including those of a spontaneous and occasional nature.""

COVID-19 testing procedures in Italy vary by region, and individuals should consult regional health authorities for further guidance. Generally, the first step is a blood test (serological test) to identify the presence of antibodies that are found in the blood following contact with the virus. To carry out this test, it is necessary to go to an authorized public or private laboratory with a prescription from a physician. This test costs approximately 15 Euro and is paid for by the individual being tested. In the event of a positive response to the blood test, a nasal swab test (oropharyngeal test) should be promptly carried out to determine if the infection is active or if there is risk of transmitted it to others. The nasal swab test is coordinated by the Italian National Health System (SSN) at no charge to the person tested.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201013215656/https://it.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/",OxCGRT
