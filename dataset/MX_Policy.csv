With poorly communicated and inconsistent messaging that offers no clear guidelines, their federal government’s inaction has given rise to widespread rumors that are beginning to stoke panic and insecurity.   Given that Mexico can look to the examples of what not to do in the early onset of this crisis — namely China in January, Italy in February and to a certain extent the United States in the first days of March — one would think political leaders there would be implementing different strategies. So far, 118 cases have been reported in Mexico.  We have not heard strong messaging from the Mexican government to “flatten the curve” in an effort to reduce rates of infection, or to practice self-isolation to mitigate transmission. President Andres Manuel López Obrador is adamant about not closing Mexico’s borders or exercising caution at airports. Perhaps his logic stems out of concerns about imposing barriers on trade. However, he has not said as much, and it is further eroding public confidence in his government’s lacking response.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20200507094919/https://thehill.com/opinion/international/488538-the-mexican-governments-response-to-covid-19-is-insufficient",OxCGRT

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the agreement with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, which also provides for production in Argentina, should result in a vaccine that the government would provide free starting in the first quarter of 2021.  He said on Thursday (Aug 13) access to the vaccine would be ""universal and free"" in Mexico, which has registered nearly 55,000 coronavirus deaths - the third-highest toll in the world behind the United States and Brazil.

Mexican authorities may perform temperature checks and health inspections at the international ports of entry and between municipalities. Southbound U.S. citizen travelers who display symptoms of COVID-19 or who decline to have their temperature checked may be denied entry to Mexico. Mexican authorities recommend that private vehicles have less than two people in them (the driver and one passenger) and all occupants wear face masks/coverings. In addition, in accordance with the U.S.-Mexico Joint Initiative to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic, authorities may deny U.S. citizens entry to Mexico if they do not demonstrate residence in Mexico or cannot prove they have an essential reason for travel. People who are transiting the border or moving within the state frequently for work should carry a letter attesting to their employment and the essential nature of their movements.    In major cities in Tamaulipas, certain vehicles are prohibited from being driven one day per week, depending on the last digit of the license plate, under the Hoy No Circula program. This measure applies to national and foreign vehicles. In certain municipalities of Tamaulipas, all work and services are suspended from 11:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m., with the exception of pharmacies, medical units, and hospitals.  Within these municipalities, the circulation of vehicles between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. is only permitted for travel to pharmacies, health care facilities, social assistance institutions, public security institutions, and institutions considered essential for the protection of individuals or property.     In a place like Chihuahua under the ORANGE category, this is what is in force there;  Monday through Friday, public transport will operate from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.  On Saturday and Sunday, public transport will operate from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., but with limited routes operating at reduced frequency.  Private transportation and rideshare companies will be permitted to accept passengers Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., with the exception of trips to or from a pharmacy or health center.  Official taxi services are permitted to operate during these hours.    For the areas in the RED category like Mexico City, travel is only for essentials.   These policies vary from one category to the other.    Please see: https://web.archive.org/web/20210118032632/https://mx.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/",OxCGRT
