Only children under six and people with health issues are exempt from the law, which comes into force on Thursday 21 May.    The decree states: ""Using masks will be compulsory on the street, in open spaces and any closed place of public use, when it is not possible to maintain a safe distance of at least two metres (6.5ft).""    While children under six are not required to wear masks, all between the ages of three and five are recommended to wear them. According to El País, that means 45 million people will now have to wear a mask and another 1.3 million will be urged to.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201014122931/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52735166",OxCGRT

Madrid, Barcelona, Lleida, Valencia, Castellón and Alicante are still in Phase 2, which means some sectors are allowed to open while the rest should remain close.    Note: I’ve coded 1T because it is the indicator that best describes the situation that affects the majority of the country.    The ‘new normality’ in Spain is expected to start from 22 June onwards, after the state of alarm ends.

Accordingly, one of the measures consists of the closure of nightclubs, dance halls and late night bars with and without live music.” See the Gobierno de España website, archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20200819194108/https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/gobierno/news/Paginas/2020/20200814_coordinatedactio.aspx",OxCGRT

Most regions in Spain have now made the use of face masks obligatory in both indoor and outdoor public spaces, even when social distancing of 1.5 metres is observed. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.    You should carry a face mask with you and be prepared to wear it during your stay. Face masks must cover the nose and mouth.    There are some exceptions to the use of face masks such as when practising sport, eating or drinking, or at the beach, however rules may vary from one region to the next. You should refer to local authorities for specific information on face-covering requirements and any exceptions where you are.""     http://web.archive.org/web/20200911154034/https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain/coronavirus-",OxCGRT

Madrid and Extremadura, the only regions that were still open to movement, will be subject to perimetral lockdowns. What’s more, these regions are limiting social meetings to a maximum of six people in open public spaces, four in closed areas and just those who live together in a private environment. There is also a curfew from 11pm to 6am, although the regions can bring this forward to 10pm if they wish.
