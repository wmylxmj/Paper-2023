While small compared to the total population of Germany (0.3%),a closure of around 100 schools should qualifies as a targeted school closure. Since Heinsberg is home to one tertiary institution (Rheinische Fachhochschule Köln in Geilenkirchen) which was not ordered to close and hence not all educational levels were affected by closures, this is coded as 2T.   https://web.archive.org/web/20200229114959/https:/www.kreis-heinsberg.de/aktuelles/aktuelles/?pid=5138; https://web.archive.org/web/20200412173517/https://rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/kreis-heinsberg/coronavirus-erste-fall-im-kreis-heinsberg-fotos_bid-49197405",OxCGRT

On 30 June 2020, the Council of the EU adopted the Council Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction (Council document 2020/912). According to this recommendation, member states intend to lift, in a coordinated and gradual way, the temporary restriction of non-essential travel into the EU for residents of certain third countries (that is, those who have their domicile or habitual residence there). The list of these third countries is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.    Based on this recommendation, Germany lifted the restrictions on travel for residents of eight third countries as of 2 July.    A first update removed two of these countries from the EU list of safe countries based on the Council Recommendation amending Recommendation (EU) 2020/912 of the Council on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction of 16 July 2020, which Germany implemented on 17 July 2020. Two more countries were classified as risk areas on 7 October 2020, which made it necessary to update the national list of safe countries.      As of 27 October 2020, Germany allows unrestricted entry for residents of the following countries: Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Uruguay    In addition, the list is to be expanded to include: Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Macao SARs of the People’s Republic of China as soon as the possibility of mutual entry is confirmed.    For all persons residing in a third country that is not included in the above list, the current restrictions on travel continue to apply, i.e. these persons may enter Germany only if they serve in an important role or if there is an urgent need for their travel. A person is considered to reside in a country if they have their domicile or habitual residence there. A person is specifically considered to have their domicile in a country if they have spent the past six months there.    The restrictions do not apply to German citizens.    EU citizens and nationals of the United Kingdom, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland and the members of their immediate family (spouse, unmarried minor children, parents of minors) are exempted from the travel restrictions.""

However, most workplaces remain open, meaning most people are required to be physically present at work. Nonetheless, high-risk areas in Germany (e.g. regions with more than 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) experience, different regulations, which frequently limit the amount of workers allowed in the workplace/office. Still, most employers only work with recommendations and not clearly laid out requirements, meaning people in Germany are still allowed to come to work even when working in high-risk regions.     However, some areas of work (like nightclubs) are still required to remain closed due to associated high risk of potentially spreading the virus when remaining open.

The original text for this guidance is dated November 11, 2020.     SYMPTOMATIC people can access tests; however, only people with severe COVID-19 symptoms or within specific groups are able to be tested. Other groups or people with mild symptoms (e.g. a ""runny nose"") may be given a no-test recommendation per official guidelines. This is to prevent and reduce the testing backlog.     Official guidance states:     ""A test must be performed if at least one of the following criteria is met:    Severe respiratory symptoms (e.g. due to acute bronchitis or pneumonia, shortness of breath or fever)  Acute hypo- or anosmia or hypo- or ageusia (disorder of the sense of smell or taste)  Unexplained disease symptoms and contact (KP1) with a confirmed COVID-19 case  Acute respiratory symptoms of any severity, especially in:  Belonging to a risk group  OR  Work in nursing, doctor's office, hospital  OR  Increased exposure probability, e.g. in the context of a possible outbreak, at events with> 10 people in closed and insufficiently ventilated rooms and insufficient application of the AHA + L rules  OR  Contact in the household or to a cluster of people with acute ARE of unexplained cause AND an increased COVID-19 7-day incidence (> 35 / 100,000 inhabitants) in the rural / urban district  OR  During the period of symptoms there was the possibility (exposure setting) of spreading to many people  OR  continued close contact with many people (as teachers, choir leaders, trainers, sex workers, etc.) or with high-risk patients (in the family, household, work)  Clinical deterioration with existing symptoms""     ASYMPTOMATIC people may also be tested in specific circumstances, including:      ""For people without symptoms who have had close contact with a person infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.    People in communal facilities and accommodation ( e.g. schools, daycare centers, refugee accommodation, emergency accommodation, penal institutions) if a person infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been found in the facility.    Patients, residents and staff in the care facility or hospital when the facility has an outbreak of the virus. This also applies, for example, to facilities for people with disabilities, rehabilitation, outpatient operations or outpatient dialysis as well as to medical and dental practices and other practices for human medical professions, day clinics and the rescue service.    Patients or assistants before admission or re-admission: especially in medical facilities for inpatient and outpatient care (excluding practices of the human, dental or other medical professions), in (partially) inpatient facilities for the care and accommodation of elderly, disabled people and people in need of care outpatient care services and integration assistance services and in day clinics.""     ***However, as tests are not generally available to asymptomatic people and due to the limitations on even testing symptomatic people, this indicator does not meet the threshold for a 3 or 2.

Between 5am and 8pm/9pm/10pm, there are more exceptions, including going to the supermarket, going to work (provided it is required and allowed under other restrictions), and exercise. In Berlin, you can only leave the house with ""valid reasons"" (effectively exceptions).

Previous coding note:   Rapid tests will be made available for the general public.  The national testing strategy will therefore be supplemented by the following measures, which are to be implemented step by step by the beginning of April:   -	In order to ensure safe school operations and safe childcare, the Länder will ensure that staff in schools and childcare facilities as well as all pupils receive the offer of at least one free rapid test per week of attendance as part of their testing concepts. A certificate of the test result shall be issued where possible.   -	For comprehensive protection against infection, it is necessary that companies in Germany offer at least one free rapid test per week to their employees who are present at work, as part of their overall contribution to society. A certificate of the test result shall be issued where possible. The Federal Government will discuss this with the business community later this week.   -	All asymptomatic citizens will be allowed a free rapid test at least once a week, including a certificate of the test result, at a testing centre operated by the respective Land or municipality, at third parties commissioned by the respective Land or municipality or at GPs’ surgeries.
