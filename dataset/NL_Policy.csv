The Dutch have chosen a targeted approach, mainly aimed at eliminating temporary liquidity issues of solvent firms. [...] While the current fiscal stance is already expansionary, the Dutch government did not announce additional fiscal expansion in relation to Covid-19. It will, however, allow automatic stabilisation, in line with existing fiscal rules. Obviously there is a need for additional health care spending. These expenditures will be allowed, although this seems to be financed with unspecified cuts to other expenditure categories.'    http://web.archive.org/web/20200502153212/https://think.ing.com/snaps/the-netherlands-targeted-economic-policy-response-to-coronavirus/",OxCGRT

For everyone in the Netherlands: stay at home if you have a cold, a cough, a sore throat or a fever. Avoid contact with others (social distancing). Only call your doctor if your symptoms worsen.

'Any company that expects to lose at least 20 per cent of its revenue may apply with the Employee Insurance Agency for an allowance that will enable it to pay its employees' wages for three months (up to a maximum of 90 per cent of the company's wage bill, depending on the loss of turnover). The Employee Insurance Agency will provide the company with an advance amounting to 80 per cent of the requested allowance. This will allow companies to keep paying their employees' salaries.'

Description on IMF website: ""A package of fiscal measures was announced to contain the economic impact of the outbreak. The package includes spending measures of about 10-20 billion euros (1-2 percent of GDP) in the next three months, and covering (i) compensation of up to 90 percent of labor costs for companies expecting a reduction in revenues of 20 percent or more; (ii) compensation for affected sectors (hospitality, travel, and others); (iii) support for entrepreneurs and the self-employed; (iv) scaling up of the short-time working scheme (unemployment benefit compensation available to companies needing to reduce their staff by at least 20 percent). In addition, companies can defer tax payments without penalties, and calculate provisional taxes on the basis of expected reduced activity levels. Also, public guarantee schemes, especially for SME loans, are expanded to help the most vulnerable companies to manage their liquidity problems. The total cost of these programs will depend on demand.""

In the week before 28 April, the government will assess what measures are necessary in the period after that date. The government urges people to stay at home during the Easter weekend. The extension means that sports facilities, establishments serving food and drink, childcare centres and other locations will remain closed until 28 April inclusive. Schools will remain closed until at least the end of the May school holidays. The ban on events still applies until 1 June. Extending the measures was necessary in order to control the spread of coronavirus, protect people in vulnerable groups and ensure that healthcare professionals and hospitals can handle the great pressure they face.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210322213129/https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-health-welfare-and-sport/news/2020/03/31/measures-to-combat-coronavirus-extended-until-tuesday-28-april-inclusive",OxCGRT

From 25 May the policy will be extended to more care homes. The government expects to be able to adapt the visiting policy for all care homes from 15 June.  ""From May 25, nursing home organizations can again allow limited visits. Minister De Jonge wrote this in his letter to the Lower House on Tuesday 19 May. De Jonge announced that between May 25 and June 15, all nursing homes that meet the preconditions can allow visits again under certain conditions. The conditions for visits apply until July 15th. Only after that date is a further relaxation of the visiting schedule possible.""

The following measures are being implemented:  Since children play a minor role in the spread of the virus, the 1.5 metre measure is less strict for young children:  * Children up to and including 12 years of age do not have to keep 1.5 metres apart from each other and from adults.   * Young people aged 13 until 18 years old (i.e. 17 years old and younger) do not have to stay 1.5 metres apart from each other. In secondary schools, this applies to all pupils, regardless of their age.  * In secondary vocational education (MBO) and higher education, all students should stay 1.5 metres apart, regardless of their age;  * Since adults play a greater role in the spread of the novel coronavirus, teachers need to stay 1.5 metres apart from others whenever possible.  Some schools are requiring older students to wear masks in corridors due to lack of space. Schools are also being urged to make sure that they have proper ventilation. Extra hygiene measures have also been put in place.    In addition, children must stay at home in case someone in their household tests positive and until they are authorized to returned to school.

The package extends the current support, much of which was scheduled to end on either August 31 or September 31 2020,  until July 1st 2021. The measures in this package amount to around € 11 billion in additional expenditure and € 1.5 billion in early investment. This includes:  - Extending the Temporary Emergency Bridging Measure for Employment (NOW) that allows entrepreneurs to be reimbursed up to 90% of their wage costs. NOW 3.0 will take effect as of October 1 2020 and will be applicable until July 1st 2021. The support over 9 months (October 1 2020 - July 1 20201) has a gradual reduction in reimbursement percentages: from 80% to 70% to 60%.  The minimum loss of turnover to be able to claim the scheme will increase from 20% to 30% from the second period.  - Extension of the Tozo (income support self-employed) up to 30 June 2021. This is the scheme to support entrepreneurs during the corona crisis. The scheme is for self-employed persons.  Tozo 3 that takes effect on October 1, 2020.   - Extension of the TVL (allowance for fixed costs for SMEs). The tax-free allowance will continue and the maximum amount per company per three months will be increased to 90,000 euros. The scheme will be extended three times for three months until June 30, 2021 and will be gradually phased out during that period, so that entrepreneurs have time and space to adapt.  - Additional, expanded or more accessible lending and guarantees to small and medium-sized companies for sufficient liquidity (BMKB-C, GO-C and KKC) will remain available after October 1, 2020.  - Entrepreneurs can apply for tax deferment until October 1, 2020. The postponement will therefore expire on 1 January 2021 at the latest.   - In total, the cabinet is allocating more than 1 billion euros for an additional social package that will help support people who may lose their jobs or who need retraining.  http://web.archive.org/web/20200831130752/https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/nieuws/2020/08/28/kabinet-verlengt-coronasteun-banen-en-economie-tot-en-met-2021  http://web.archive.org/web/20200831132719/https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-financiele-regelingen/overzicht-financiele-regelingen/now/veranderingen-per-1-oktober  http://web.archive.org/web/20200831132957/https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-financiele-regelingen/overzicht-financiele-regelingen/tozo",OxCGRT

Retail stores must close no later than 20.00. There will be no late-night shopping.  Grocery stores may stay open later.  Coffee shops (cannabis cafés) may only provide a takeaway service and must close by 20.00.    Events are banned, with the exception of:  food markets  trade fairs and conferences  cinemas and theatres  matches or competitions  demonstrations, gatherings and meetings as referred to in the Public Assemblies Act  Travel as little as possible.

""Following the basic rules remains vital in order to reduce the number of infections. Anyone who has symptoms, even mild symptoms, should stay at home and get tested as soon as possible. Anyone who is infected should ask others to do shopping and other tasks for them, so they can stay at home. Everyone should stay 1.5 metres apart and leave if places become too busy. You are strongly advised to wear a face mask in indoor public spaces.  (...) - You may receive no more than 3 people a day in your home. You may receive no more than one group of people per day. - The maximum group size outdoors is 4 people from different households.  - Travel as little as possible. - Work from home, unless that is not possible. - Everyone aged 13 and over must wear a face mask in indoor public spaces and on public transport.""

It is vital that schools, childcare centres and parents do everything possible to limit the number of contacts as much as possible. Childcare staff will soon be eligible for priority testing. School staff already have priority for coronavirus testing and this will continue. A trial involving rapid testing for primary school teachers will start soon. In the very short term the education and social affairs & employment ministries will issue additional guidelines aimed at minimising the risk of infection at primary schools and childcare centres. Centres for out-of-school care (BSO) must stay closed, as this could lead to extra contacts and positive cases.    Secondary schools will remain closed until at least 1 March – after the February school holidays. They will remain open for some groups, including pupils in the upper years of secondary school sitting exams this year and vulnerable pupils. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has drafted new guidelines aimed at minimising the risk of infection, so that these schools will be able to reopen safely in the near future. To see how the guidelines work in practice for a whole school, some secondary schools will allow more pupils to come to school as of next week.

Some people have hardly any symptoms, while others become seriously ill. However, it is clear that some groups have a higher risk of becoming very ill or even dying.    People aged 70 and over have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they get coronavirus. This applies to healthy older people, but particularly to older people who are not fully independent. People with underlying health conditions also have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. If you have health issues, take extra care and follow the basic rules carefully.    Visits to care homes are allowed as long as this does not hamper efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Residents at the end of their life or in a critical condition are always allowed to have visitors. Care homes will assess the situation and decide when residents can receive more visitors. Guidelines have been drawn up for this purpose.   In the event of an outbreak in a care home, all residents and staff will be tested weekly.  It is especially important to follow the basic rules when visiting people who fall into an at-risk group. This includes staying 1.5 metres apart. Make clear arrangements and check before the visit whether anyone has symptoms. If a visitor or a person they want to visit has cold-like symptoms, a fever or shortness of breath, the visit should be postponed. Visits should take place outdoors, if possible, because this is safer.""    /web/20210226152456/https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/basic-rules-for-everyone",OxCGRT

It is vital that schools and parents do everything possible to limit the number of contacts as much as possible. For some time now, anyone working in the education sector has been able to get tested with priority status, and that will not change.

Some people have hardly any symptoms, while others become seriously ill. However, it is clear that some groups have a higher risk of becoming very ill or even dying.    People aged 70 and over have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they get coronavirus. This applies to healthy older people, but particularly to older people who are not fully independent. People with underlying health conditions also have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. If you have health issues, take extra care and follow the basic rules carefully.    Visits to care homes are allowed as long as this does not hamper efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Residents at the end of their life or in a critical condition are always allowed to have visitors. Care homes will assess the situation and decide when residents can receive more visitors. Guidelines have been drawn up for this purpose.   In the event of an outbreak in a care home, all residents and staff will be tested weekly.  It is especially important to follow the basic rules when visiting people who fall into an at-risk group. This includes staying 1.5 metres apart. Make clear arrangements and check before the visit whether anyone has symptoms. If a visitor or a person they want to visit has cold-like symptoms, a fever or shortness of breath, the visit should be postponed. Visits should take place outdoors, if possible, because this is safer.""    /web/20210226152456/https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/basic-rules-for-everyone",OxCGRT

The ban was initially imposed to stem the spread of a variant strain of COVID-19 originally identified in the UK; however, this strain has spread within the Netherlands to such an extent that a travel ban has no added value. Travelers from the UK are still required to present proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival.    Authorities previously extended the ban on flights with South Africa and many countries in Central and South America until at least April 1 due to concerns related to variant strains of COVID-19 in those countries. The targeted locations in the Americas currently include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Air freight transport is exempt from the travel ban.    Travel to the Netherlands is generally only permitted for European Economic Area (EEA) residents or Schengen-associated countries and residents of Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Officials prohibit most travel from other countries; however, effective March 9, the list of travel exemptions has been expanded to include healthcare workers, people traveling to seek medical attention, persons traveling for urgent family reasons, staff traveling to or from British or Dutch drilling platforms, air or sea crews traveling in the exercise of their work, transiting EEA or Schengen Area residents, and returning Dutch nationals and residents.    All permitted travelers must possess proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival. All permitted travelers arriving via sea or air must also undergo a rapid COVID-19 test no more than four hours prior to boarding. Authorities will not accept results from self-administered tests. Transit passengers are also subject to this requirement. Aircrews must undergo a rapid antigen test upon disembarking. Other transport sector workers must undergo a rapid antigen test no more than 24 hours prior to departure. Additionally, all travelers must fill out a declaration form prior to entry and self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period. These measures do not apply to individuals arriving from Iceland, the Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand; additional exceptions are possible for individuals with an essential function or need, such as health workers, on-duty security forces, freight workers, and diplomats.""",OxCGRT

However, it is clear that some groups have a higher risk of becoming very ill or even dying.    People aged 70 and over have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they get coronavirus. This applies to healthy older people, but particularly to older people who are not fully independent. People with underlying health conditions also have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. If you have health issues, take extra care and follow the basic rules carefully.    Visits to nursing homes are allowed as long as this does not hamper efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Residents at the end of their life or in a critical condition are always allowed to have visitors. Nursing homes will assess the situation and decide when residents can receive more visitors. Guidelines have been drawn up for this purpose.   More and more residents of nursing homes and care homes for people with disabilities are being vaccinated. Because of this the rules for visits can be eased:  If the residents in a home have had both of their vaccine injections, they can receive 2 visitors per day instead of 1.  Residents can receive other visitors than the 2 or 3 people in their ‘visitor bubble’.  In the event of an outbreak in a nursing home, all residents and staff will be tested weekly.  It is especially important to follow the basic rules when visiting people who fall into an at-risk group. This includes staying 1.5 metres apart. Make clear arrangements and check before the visit whether anyone has symptoms. If a visitor or a person they want to visit has cold-like symptoms, a fever or shortness of breath, the visit should be postponed. Visits should take place outdoors, if possible, because this is safer.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20210318104343/https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/basic-rules-for-everyone",OxCGRT

Officials prohibit most travel from other countries. Exemptions, however, are in place for healthcare workers, people traveling to seek medical attention, persons traveling for urgent family reasons, staff traveling to or from British or Dutch drilling platforms, air or sea crews traveling in the exercise of their work, transiting EEA or Schengen Area residents, and returning Dutch nationals and residents.  All permitted travelers must possess a negative result from a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival. All permitted travelers arriving via sea or air must also undergo a rapid COVID-19 test no more than four hours prior to boarding. Authorities will not accept results from self-administered tests. Transit passengers are also subject to this requirement. Aircrews must undergo a rapid antigen test upon disembarking. Other transport sector workers must undergo a rapid antigen test no more than 24 hours prior to departure. Additionally, all travelers must fill out a declaration form prior to entry and self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period. These measures do not apply to individuals arriving from Iceland, the Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand; additional exceptions are possible for individuals with an essential function or need, such as health workers, on-duty security forces, freight workers, and diplomats.  Authorities have extended a ban on flights with South Africa and many countries in Central and South America until at least April 1 due to concerns related to variant strains of COVID-19 in those countries. The targeted locations in the Americas currently include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Air freight transport is exempt from the travel ban.

Each establishment may have a maximum of 50 guests. Each guest must be assigned a seat. Self-service is not allowed. No more than 2 people may be seated at a table, sitting 1.5 metres apart. However, this limit does not apply if everyone at the table is part of the same household or if the party includes children under 13. Visitors can go indoors only to pay, use the cloakroom or go to the toilet. Face masks must be worn indoors.     These conditions will be relaxed further in the next steps of the reopening plan.     Shops and markets to reopen  All shops may admit customers without an appointment. Certain conditions still apply, such as a limit on the number of shoppers allowed inside at the same time. It’s still important to avoid busy places, so go to the shops at quiet times, such as early in the morning. And go alone if possible. Shops selling non-essential goods, such as clothes shops, can be open between 6:00 and 20:00. Supermarkets and other shops selling essential goods may operate in accordance with their usual opening hours. Wearing a face mask in shops is still compulsory.

All travelers that arrive from very high-risk locations need to present either a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding transport or a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in the Netherlands coupled with a negative rapid antigen COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding. These travelers will also need to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period. Vaccinated passengers are also subject to this requirement. Exceptions are possible for individuals with an essential function or need, such as cross-border workers, health workers, on-duty security forces, freight workers, and diplomats.    Entry is generally only permitted for residents of EEA or Schengen-associated countries, as well as those of the Dutch Caribbean Territories, Australia, China, New Zealand, Japan, Rwanda, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Officials prohibit most travel from other countries. Exemptions are in place for healthcare workers, people traveling to seek medical attention, persons traveling for urgent family reasons, staff traveling to or from British or Dutch drilling platforms, air or sea crews traveling in the performance of their work, transiting EEA or Schengen Area residents, and returning Dutch nationals and residents.    Individuals arriving from designated low-risk destinations may enter the Netherlands without restrictions. As of June 15, authorities classify Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, France (only the island of Corsica), Germany, Greece (the North Aegean Region and the Ionian Islands Region only) Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, San Marino, Vatican, New Zealand, Norway (except for Oslo and Agder), Portugal, Poland, Rwanda, Slovakia, Luxembourg Singapore, South Korea, Spain (the Balearic, and the Canary Islands), Thailand, Israel Curacao, Aruba Bonaire, St Maarten, Saba, and St Eustatius as low-risk destinations.

This campaign first went live in September 2020, but was then temporarily halted due to the increasing number of infections. The campaign invites travelers to travel by public transport. “Now that we are allowed to travel more often in the Netherlands, public transport is playing an increasingly important role,” says Pedro Peters, chairman of OV-NL, trade association for public transport in the Netherlands.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210623093013/https://www.ov-nl.nl/het-licht-staat-op-groen-voor-het-openbaar-vervoer-2/    https://web.archive.org/web/20210801215256/https://over.gvb.nl/nieuws/start-landelijke-campagne-het-ov-is-ok/",OxCGRT

Currently, the only valid entry pass is a negative test result obtained through pre-admission testing. From 23 June proof of vaccination and proof of recovery can also be used. These 3 options can be displayed in the CoronaCheck app, which is being updated. Coronavirus entry passes are expected to be used mostly for festivals and other events. Dance venues, like nightclubs and discos, can also use a coronavirus entry pass system, in which case they can open without restrictions.

All travelers that arrive from very high-risk locations need to present either a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding transport or a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in the Netherlands coupled with a negative rapid antigen COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours prior to boarding. These travelers will also need to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival; this can be shortened by taking a COVID-19 test on or after day five of the self-isolation period. Vaccinated passengers are also subject to this requirement.

3841438,3841438,NL,2021-07-31,C8,3.0,,"""Authorities have amended the nation's COVID-19-related entry requirements. From July 27, the Netherlands will not designate any EU countries at the orange (high) risk level except when a new variant strain is present. In addition, starting Aug. 8, all travelers aged 12 or older who have not been fully vaccinated or have not recovered from the disease in the last six months will need to show a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before arrival or a negative result from an antigen test no older than 24 hours before returning to the Netherlands from an EU country designated at the yellow (medium) level of risk. Furthermore, from Aug. 8, all travelers arriving from designated green (low) risk destinations outside of the EU will need to either present a certificate of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result upon arrival.    Authorities generally permit entry for residents of EEA or Schengen-associated countries, as well as those of the Dutch Caribbean Territories and several other countries outside of the Schengen Zone, including the US, Australia, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea. Individuals arriving from designated low-risk destinations must fill out a health declaration form before entering. There are currently no other entry restrictions for travelers from these locations. For a full list of low-risk countries and territories, please click here.    Officials prohibit most travel from other countries. Exemptions are in place for healthcare workers, people traveling to seek medical attention, those traveling for urgent family reasons, staff traveling to or from British or Dutch drilling platforms, air or sea crews traveling in the performance of their work, transiting EEA or Schengen Area residents, and returning Dutch nationals and residents. All travelers arriving via air must fill out a declaration form before entry.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20210806151957/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/506811/netherlands-authorities-amend-covid-19-international-entry-requirements-from-july-27-update-42",OxCGRT
