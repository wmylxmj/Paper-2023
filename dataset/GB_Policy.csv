Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock  “We are currently testing the new NHS contact tracing app. If you become unwell with symptoms of coronavirus, you’ll be able to tell the NHS via this app. The app will then send an alert to other app users that you’ve been in significant contact with in recent days, even before you had the symptoms. So that they know and they can act accordingly, so we can get tests to people even if they are asymptomatic.”",OxCGRT

So as of 22 July, some sectors are still closed in England. In the city of Leicester, which is under a stricter lockdown due to a rise in cases, most businesses are closed, though cafes and restaurants can operate takeaway services.

Therefore, the coding is upgraded to 4G on review.   It should be noted, however, that technically not ALL private gatherings are reduced to a level 4 due to Wales allowing outdoor gatherings of slightly bigger groups. On rainy days, of which Wales has a considerable amount, outdoor gatherings outside of someones gardens (for which the rule of six applies even outside) are somewhat unlikely and a coding of 4 is therefore appropriate. https://web.archive.org/web/20201004213732/https://gov.wales/guidance-leaving-your-home-and-seeing-other-people-coronavirus (Wales) https://web.archive.org/web/20201004214002/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51506729 (England) https://web.archive.org/web/20201004214404/https://www.irishpost.com/news/rule-of-six-how-todays-new-social-gathering-restrictions-affect-you-192812 (NI) (Scotland in previous sources)",OxCGRT

The only exception is the ability to gather in groups of up to 30 outside in Wales.   As per the entry of Sep 14 (It should be noted, however, that technically not ALL private gatherings are reduced to a level 4 due to Wales allowing outdoor gatherings of slightly bigger groups. On rainy days, of which Wales has a considerable amount, outdoor gatherings outside of someones gardens (for which the rule of six applies even outside) are somewhat unlikely and a coding of 4 is therefore appropriate.), such an exception is still considered 4G in my opinion, although a case for 4T (excluding Wales) also exists. https://web.archive.org/web/20201004214002/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51506729",OxCGRT

The scheme allows employers to keep staff on the payroll but without them coming to work, with the Government paying 80 per cent of their salaries, up to a maximum cap of £2,500.    From 1 July, the Government has reduced its support from 80 per cent of employees’ wages to 70 per cent.    Employers will then have to top up the remaining 10 per cent, so staff still receive 80 per cent of their salaries.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210630172019/https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/work/furlough-when-end-hmrc-scheme-changes-july-2021-new-rules-how-long-finish-explained-1079553",OxCGRT

2548168,2548168,GB,2021-08-05,C8,3.0,,"Changes to UK International arrivals lists on 5 Aug:    The UK government has today (5 August 2021) announced that arrivals from France to England will no longer need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated.    The step aligns France with the rest of the amber list now that the proportion of beta variant cases has fallen, where those who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised and administered in the UK, US or Europe do not need to quarantine when arriving in England.    This move also simplifies the system to 3 categories, as well as the green watchlist to give travellers notice where green status is at risk.    arrivals from France will no longer need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated  Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway to be added to the government’s green list for travel  India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will also be moved from the red to the amber list  Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte added to the red list to safeguard domestic vaccine rollout    https://web.archive.org/web/20210806111415/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-travel-country-listings-update",OxCGRT
